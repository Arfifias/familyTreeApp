# familyTreeApp
Family Tree application made back in College as a freshman which basically if somebody gives two names via a command in the editor's command line it returns the relationship between the names. If you are familiar with Game of Thrones you should know the Baratheon family

DISCLAIMER: This project was made back in the day when I was a sophomore, in collaboration with a classmate which I will have his profile linked here. But I won't give credit to @DionisisAthanasiadis because he did nothing about the project at all and since having paid money from my pocket for this specific project in the internet cafe makes me even more furious about the situation and then he just uploads it in Github just like that because we were a "team", where I coded 500 lines of code and Artemis did the csv file and the other classes but the main was done by me. Please pay a visit to his profile
