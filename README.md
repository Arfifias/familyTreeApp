# familyTreeApp
Family Tree application made back in College as a freshman which basically if somebody gives two names via a command in the editor's command line it returns the relationship between the names. If you are familiar with Game of Thrones you should know the Baratheon family

DISCLAIMER: This project was made back in the day when I was a sophomore, in collaboration with a classmate which I will have his profile linked here. But I won't give credit to @DionisisAthanasiadis because he did nothing about the project at all amd he just uploads it in Github just like that because we were a "team", where I wrote 500 lines of code and Artemis did the csv file and the other class but the main was done by me. Please pay a visit to his profile
